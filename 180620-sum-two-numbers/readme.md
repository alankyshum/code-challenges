### Add Two Numbers

- https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/

> You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order** and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
<!-- /excerpt -->
> You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Retro

1. Do not make assumptions
   1. Assumed number to be small -> use parseInt -> Failed
   2. Assumed 2 lists are of the same length -> Failed
2. ==Should try to think some edge cases==
